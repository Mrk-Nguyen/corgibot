Recommend you come up with a clever name such as "jarvis" or "pollo" for your bot.

Here is a good pic of Pollo you can use:

4. Copy the API Token and set it in your environment variable on your server (or send the token to someone who is setting up the server for you).
5. Wait for the token to be added and for the server to be deployed.
6. Create a private channel and invite your bot with `/invite @pollo`, assuming you named your bot "pollo"
7. Issue a command to test the bot: `pollo corgi me`
8. Other commands the bot supports:

	- `corgi me`
	- `corgi bomb`
	- `corgi bomb N` where N is number of pics
	- `stumps`
	- `love you`
	- `have a bone`
9. Corgi bot also has `pug-me` too that supports the commands
   - `pug me`
   - `pug bomb`
   - `pug bomb N` where N is number of pics
10. Invite the bot to whatever other channel you want the corgi-bot to be in.
